                <h3>Q: As a specialist, do I need to have services authorized before I perform them?</h3>
                <p>A: Certain services and procedures require prior authorization before they can be rendered, and these are listed on the back of the Medical Necessity Form. If you determine that your patient needs one of these services or procedures, you must request prior authorization from Peoples Health to ensure those services will be covered. To request authorization, you must complete and fax a Medical Necessity Form to the Peoples Health Medical Management department at one of the numbers listed on the form before rendering services.</p>
                <p>There are some exceptions to this listing, which can be determined by using the <a href="http://staging.peopleshealth.com/for-providers/procedure-code-search/">Authorization Requirements Search</a>. You can search the database by selecting a place of service code and inputting a CPT code to determine if the procedure requires prior authorization.</p>
